## 🤖 Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **DebateSession Service**: Orchestrates entire debate flow
- **AI Agent Wrappers**: Pro, Con, and Judge model interfaces
- **Streaming Handler**: Real-time token delivery to UI
- **State Machine**: Manages debate progression

### Model Configuration

- **Debating Models**: 2x GPT-3.5-Turbo (Pro stance, Con stance)
- **Judge Model**: 1x GPT-3.5-Turbo (impartial evaluation)
- **Token Limits**: 300 tokens/turn, 15,000 tokens/session max
- **Safety**: OpenAI moderation endpoint for topics

### Debate Flow

1. **Topic Input** → Moderation check
2. **Round 1-3** → Pro argues → Con responds (seeing Pro's argument)
3. **Judge Evaluation** → Final verdict based on full transcript
4. **Results Display** → Winner announcement + share options

## 🎨 User Experience Priorities

### Core UX Principles

1. **Streaming is King**: Ultra-smooth token flow over fancy animations
2. **Immediate Clarity**: Clear model labels, stances, and progress
3. **One Polished Moment**: Confetti winner announcement
4. **Binge-Watchable**: Debates should be entertaining and educational

### Desktop-First Approach

- Minimum viable responsive design
- Optimized for desktop debate viewing
- Mobile optimization deferred to V2

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation for model failures
- "Point forfeited" messaging for timeouts
- Red banners for technical issues
- Judge considers failures in verdict
