DEBAITE: AI-POWERED DEBATE PLATFORM
Version 1.0 | MVP Specification

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Debaite transforms traditional AI chatbots into an engaging debate platform where two AI agents argue opposing sides of user-submitted topics while a third AI judge evaluates the discussion. The platform makes critical thinking "binge-watchable" through real-time streaming debates that users can watch, share, and learn from.

VISION: "One-click Oxford-style AI debate engine—two GPT agents argue Pro & Con in real time while a third AI judge crowns the winner. Streaming UI makes critical thinking binge-watchable."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Current AI chat applications offer one-dimensional interactions between users and single AI models. This format lacks:
- Exposure to multiple perspectives on complex topics
- Structured argumentation and critical thinking frameworks
- Engaging, shareable content that educates while entertaining
- Objective evaluation of competing arguments

Educational institutions, debate enthusiasts, and curious individuals need tools that:
- Present balanced viewpoints on controversial topics
- Demonstrate quality argumentation techniques
- Provide impartial evaluation of competing ideas
- Create viral, educational content for social sharing

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SOLUTION OVERVIEW

Debaite provides a structured AI debate platform with three core components:

1. DUAL AI DEBATERS: Two GPT-3.5-Turbo agents argue opposing sides (Pro vs Con)
2. AI JUDGE: Third GPT-3.5-Turbo agent evaluates debate quality and declares winner
3. STREAMING INTERFACE: Real-time token delivery creates engaging viewing experience

KEY DIFFERENTIATORS:
- Real-time streaming creates Netflix-like engagement
- Structured debate format ensures quality arguments
- Shareable replays enable viral educational content
- Minimal user input required (just topic submission)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
